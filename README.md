# pandas-challenge-1
I started this challenge similar to the previous ones:
- Looked at Activity solutions that were similar to questions asked
- Copy/Paste code as appropiate
- Update variables

When I had issues I went to office hours as it seemed me and my classmates had issues in similar categories, those sections were:
- Rating the sub Categories " # For the category with the most entries, # which subcategory had the most entries? "
- Calculating Shipping "# Create a column for shipping price. # Assume a shipping price of $7 per pound # for orders over 50 pounds and $10 per # pound for items 50 pounds or under.
- Confirming totals "# Check your work using the totals above"

The section I struggled the most with was getting totals to match, I rewatched the office hours and I noticed that they had different code than I did and I did not want to re-change mine to match theirs so I reached out to the "Ask BCS" feature. 
The teaching assistant helped me see that I was not taking the quantity of items into the weight calculation. We made those edits as I was missing a line of text and then my totals came closer to the verified data. 

I did not go back to do additional checks as I am already late on assignment and I understand the concept. I will ask what my miscalcualtion was during our next office hours but I do not want to wait another day to submit my assignment. My totals were off by a small amount.
